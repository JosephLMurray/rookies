# 📝Steps

## We had to create or HTML layout in seperate Html files, when we were happy with our results, we then moved it and compiled our HTML to handlebars. We also had to create our own database. With the help of Sportsdata.io, we used their api and pulled all their data. With eachplayers Data, from: Team, Stats, Position, Name, and more. We had to route all of our pages to match handle bars page names. An example: When a user wants to get access to our choose a team/player page, they would have to log in first. Then they can access the members routes. With the help of dBeaver and mySql, we had a bunch of datas pulling back towards us. Anything we needed baseball related.
